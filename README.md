# Data Structures Practice Repository

This repository contains my practice code for data structures in Java. I use this repository to learn and improve my skills in implementing various data structures and algorithms.

## Introduction

Welcome to my Data Structures Practice Repository! In this repository, you'll find Java implementations of various data structures and solutions to common algorithmic problems. I use this repository to practice and showcase my coding skills and understanding of data structures.

Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, and provide feedback if you need improvements or suggestions.

## Data Structures Covered

Here are some of the data structures implemented in this repository:

- Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- ...and more!
